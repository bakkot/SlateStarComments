# Slate Star Comments

This script adds some features to the comment system at [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/). In particular:

- New comments are highlighted and given the searchable text "\~new\~" so that you can C-f through them in the order they appear on the page.
- An expandable box appears in the upper-right, which allows you to set the time after which comments are highlighted and gives you a list of new comments. Clicking an entries in the list will bring you to that entry.
- A button to hide a comment and its subthread, appearing at the bottom of every comment.
- For nested comments, a link to their parent.

Suggestions and pull requests welcome, although I'm very conservative when it comes to changes in the UI.
